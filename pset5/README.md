# Speller (2018)
## Objective:
Implement speller, a program that spell-checks a file.
To do this, we had to code the file **dictionary.c**, where there were four main functions:
 - load(): to load a dictionary file and store its words into a hashtable.
 - check(): check if the words of the given text matched those of the dictionary.
 - size(): indicate the number of words in the dictionary file.
 - unload(): unload all the allocated memory within our hashtable.
 # Homepage (2019)

Build a simple homepage using HTML and CSS.
Requirements:
